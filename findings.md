## 2026-04-29 — Chat 1 — Additional primitives discovered beyond spec

**What was expected:** Spec §7 listed 11 primitives in `app/ui/dashboard/primitives/`.

**What was found:** Glob returned 18 primitives — additional 7 not in spec: `BarcodePreview`, `BookCover`, `DueDatePicker`, `IsbnLookupBox`, `NotificationItem`, `ReminderButton`, `RoleBadge`, `TransactionReceipt`, `UserAvatar`.

**Implication:** Plan tasks were extended to cover all 18. No spec change needed — spec was directional, not exhaustive.

## 2026-04-29 — Chat 1 — ThemeProvider is custom, not `next-themes`

**What was expected:** Spec §8.1 risk mitigation referenced `next-themes` `disableTransitionOnChange`.

**What was found:** Project uses a custom `ThemeProvider` at `app/ui/theme/themeProvider.tsx`. It already toggles `dark`/`light` classes on `<html>` with localStorage + cookie persistence.

**Implication:** Tailwind `dark:` prefix works as-is against this custom provider. **Do not introduce `next-themes`** during migration. If hydration flash becomes a problem, fix within the existing provider's SSR cookie-read path rather than swapping libraries.

## 2026-04-29 — Chat 2 — No ESLint setup in this project

**What was expected:** Plan's per-chat quality gate calls `pnpm lint && pnpm tsc --noEmit`.

**What was found:** `package.json` has scripts `build`/`dev`/`start`/`test`/`test:watch` only — no `lint` script, no `.eslintrc*` / `eslint.config.*` file, and no ESLint packages in `devDependencies`.

**Implication:** Per-task quality gate for Batch 1 onwards uses `pnpm tsc --noEmit` only. Do not chase a missing lint setup — the plan's lint expectation was aspirational. If lint discipline is desired later, it's a separate task (add ESLint + Next.js config + script). Future chats: don't run `pnpm lint`; run typecheck.
